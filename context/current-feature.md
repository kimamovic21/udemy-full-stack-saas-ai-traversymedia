# Current Feature: Homepage Mockup

## Status

In Progress

## Goals

- Create a static marketing homepage in `prototypes/homepage/` with `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`
- Hero section with "chaos to order" concept: floating icons (left), pulsing arrow (center), dashboard preview (right)
- Animated chaos icons that drift, bounce off walls, and repel from mouse cursor
- Fixed top nav with logo, Features/Pricing links, Sign In/Get Started buttons
- Features section with 6 cards using item type accent colors
- AI section with Pro Feature badge, capabilities checklist, and code editor mockup
- Pricing section with Free vs Pro cards, yearly toggle ($72/yr), Pro highlighted as "Most Popular"
- CTA section and footer with logo, link columns, dynamic copyright year
- Scroll fade-in animations and navbar opacity on scroll
- Responsive: stack hero vertically on mobile, single column grids, arrow rotates 90°

## Notes

- Dark theme with accent colors: Snippet (#3b82f6), Prompt (#f59e0b), Command (#06b6d4), Note (#22c55e), File (#64748b), Image (#ec4899), URL (#6366f1)
- This is a standalone static prototype, NOT part of the Next.js app
- Chaos icons use requestAnimationFrame for animation
- Arrow has CSS pulse animation
- Full spec at context/features/homepage-mockup-spec.md

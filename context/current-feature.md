# Current Feature: Add Pro Badge to Sidebar

Add a pro badge to the Files and Images item types in the sidebar.

## Status

In Progress

## Goals

- Add PRO badge next to Files item type in sidebar
- Add PRO badge next to Images item type in sidebar
- Use ShadCN UI Badge component
- Keep badge clean and subtle
- Display "PRO" in uppercase

## Notes

- Files and Images are Pro-only features per project spec
- Badge should be visually subtle to not distract from the item type
